# p1_Welcome to Retro Adventure

<!--this line is a comment-->
Welcome to our game of high adventure. The first thing you should do is make some characters for your adventuring party.

[b]"How do I do that?" you might ask?[/b]

Well, click on and see.

# p2_Creating a Character
The Adventure awaits.

    # The Adventure begins
    Why is this surrounded in gray?

I guess that's just the way it goes.

* Next<!--goto_p3_-->

# p3_The End
We do need, however, to start doing some kind of choices.
* Here is one<!--goto_p5_-->
* Here is another<!--goto_p4_-->

# p4_Test for "another"
This is the text for another screen.

* Next<!--goto_p10_-->

# p5_Test for "one"
Here is the test for one screen.

Hope you like it.

* Next<!--goto_p6_-->

# p6_COMBAT
3:
_Bear_
_Cat_
_Horse_

* Win<!--goto_p10_-->
* Lose<!--goto_p5_-->

# p10_Pick up here
Seems like if I did this it would automatically go to the next page.

If there are any choices in a page then it would goto the specified page number.

Otherwise, it just goes to the next page.
